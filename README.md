The purpose of this project is to demonstrate student's understanding of css and html we have learn so far. In class, we have cover the jigsaw mini lessons and also uses it to create a copy-cat website. We get to choose which website we are planning on making base on the difficulty that we think we could challenge. At the beginning of the process, we are told to create a planning page and set a create a timeline for ourselves. 

Something that I learn from doing this project is that it's difficult and you'll run into many errors or something won't go the way you wanted to go if a code is misplace. For example, the opacity of the box around the welcome and sign in are hard because you can't put the opacity outside the rgb() because it will overlap.
